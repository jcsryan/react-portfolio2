                <p>As a front end developer I will work towards creating and maintaining clear, well documented, and concise code that translates into an elegant and easily navigable user experience. Creating beautiful bespoke user interfaces with React requires both technical knowledge and an eye for proportion and design, having spent the previous decade in a presentation focused career I have a solid understanding of what visually appeals to a customer base. Now, leveraging the knowledge and skills learned from the University of Texas certificate program, I am able to draft and create applications that utilize that experience. To date I have been contracted to make a number of MERN based web pages for local businesses in the greater Boston area. I am shifting careers after a decade and the selling of my previous business in favor of a new challenge. I have a drive built over years of hard work, progress, and success. Now as I begin in this new field I want to carry over that motivation and my unique perspective.  </p>

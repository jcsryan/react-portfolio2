                <p>As a newly-certified front end developer with a strong consumer background,  I create and maintain clear, well documented, and concise code that translates into an elegant and easily navigable user experience. Building beautiful bespoke user interfaces with React requires both technical knowledge and an eye for proportion and design. Having spent the last decade in a career focused on effective presentation that demanded daily results, I have a solid understanding of what visually appeals to a customer base along with a drive built over years of hard work and success.  Now, as I begin in this new field, I am ready to apply my unique perspective to new challenges by leveraging my creative discipline with the technical knowledge and skills learned when finishing at the top of my class at the University of Texas Coding Boot Camp. I have already been contracted to make a number of MERN based web pages for local businesses in the greater Boston area, and am excited for any opportunity to expand my knowledge and grow my skills. I want to carry over my unique perspective
